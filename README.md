SDL-thingy
==========

An SDL engine and (eventually) game. Lots of change expected here.

11/27 - upload coming soon: basic Canvas, Sprite (and a few modular classes like Sprite_bounds and Sprite_scale), Stage, and Camera classes sketched up in headers and partially implemented

to be added pretty soon:
* separating-axis collision detection (for both rotating and axis-bound boxes)
* actual game loop (thread later)

4/18/14 - this is probably not happening anymore
