TODO
-get rid of Top.h and do individual includes

-get rid of Sprite_bounds and just have one vector of bounds in Sprite_base
	-make providing bounds optional
	-init bounds in Sprite_base
	-add collision circle to Sprite_base

-make checkCollide for all the sprite classes
	-incremental detection
	-rotatable quads
	-pruning
		-is this affordable?

-make Stage hold GameEntity objects

COLLISION DETECTION
here's the plan:

bounding rects for sprites that support rotation are made into rotatable quads at creation
dest only serves as a generic offset rectangle
rotate all points in all of a sprite's bounds in update()
draw using dest and the rotation point and offset
collision detection will use pre-rotated quads

1. use circles first; if this is false, stop trying
2. then use border rect; if this is false, stop trying
3. then use bound rects if the class has 'em (make this shit optional)
